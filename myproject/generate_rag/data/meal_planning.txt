üóìÔ∏è Meal Planning Basics
1. Weekly Planning
Plan meals for 5‚Äì7 days, including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.

Consider school/work schedule, events, and travel.

Include leftover-friendly dishes like maharage, pilau, or ugali-based meals.

Rotate main carbs (ugali, rice, matoke, cassava, sweet potatoes).

2. Grocery Shopping
Make a market-specific list (vegetables, grains, protein, spices).

Shop after meals to avoid impulse buys.

Stick to the list ‚Äî prioritize fresh & seasonal items like:

Mchicha, sukuma wiki, spinach

Mangoes, avocados, bananas, passionfruit

Buy from local markets (masoko) to save money and get fresh produce.

3. Meal Prep
Batch-cook beans, ndizi, and rice for multiple days.

Pre-wash and store mchicha, sukuma, cabbage in airtight containers.

Prepare dough (chapati, maandazi) and refrigerate or freeze.

Label and date leftovers or freezer meals (e.g., wali wa nazi, maharage ya nazi).
